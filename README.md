# EDA Psychology Project

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on psychological behavior data, visualizing patterns in social media usage, content preferences, and user habits using Python.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal is to:
- Understand the relationships between different psychological and behavioral traits.
- Analyze the influence of platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, etc.
- Prepare the data for modeling using techniques like Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- The dataset includes usage patterns of platforms such as:
  - `torrent`, `fb`, `snapct`, `linkdn`, `telegm`, `netflix`, `prime`
- The target variable represents user behavior or outcome (e.g., mental wellness, interest, etc.)

> *(You can add where you got the dataset from if it's public or mention it's private.)*
